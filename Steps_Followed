Step 1:
Created EKS and AKS with the use of cli

AWS:
eksctl create cluster \
  --name my-eks-cluster \
  --version 1.29 \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --nodegroup-name standard-workers \
  --node-type t2.micro \
  --nodes 4 \
  --nodes-min 1 \
  --nodes-max 4 \
  --managed

EKS:
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus               #created the resource group first

az aks create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --node-count 4 \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --node-vm-size Standard_B2S


Step 2:

Created a simple project
Wrote the Dockerfile
Build and pushed it to DockerHub
(Through github action workflow)
Verified it.


Step 3:

Wrote the deployment, service file for both clouds.
Also wrote the security check file for both clouds.

Step 4:
Deployed it to AKS and EKS through github action workflow and used matrix for use of both clouds.

Step 5:
Wrote the gatekeeper policy through which we disallow the use of tag LATEST.

Step 6:

initialized a git repo
Pushed our code to the repo (git push origin main)

Step 7:

Waited for the pipeline to execute all the stages.
